    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll install the popular [XGBoost](http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) library and explore how to use this popular boosting model to classify different types of wine using the [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) from the UCI Machine Learning Dataset Repository.  \n",

    "## Objectives\n",

    "## Installing XGBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "Run this lab on your local computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The XGBoost model is not currently included in scikit-learn, so we'll have to install it on our own.  To install XGBoost, you'll need to use `conda`. \n",
    "\n",
    "To install XGBoost, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open up a new terminal window \n",
    "2. Activate your conda environment\n",
    "3. Run `conda install py-xgboost`. You must use `conda` to install this package -- currently, it cannot be installed using `pip`  \n",
    "4. Once the installation has completed, run the cell below to verify that everything worked "

We've also learned how to tune the model for better performance using the grid search methodology we learned previously. XGBoost is a powerful modeling tool to have in your arsenal. Don't be afraid to experiment with it! "
